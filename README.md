# ghanasprouts

First(?) played on Pi Day (International Day of Mathematics, 14 March 2024) at Fodome Helu Roman Catholic Junior High
School, Hohoe District, Volta Region, Ghana
Background: Since the theme of IDM this year was “Playing With Math”, US Peace Corps Volunteer and math teacher Bruce
Bayly proposed the pencil-and-paper game “Sprouts” (invented in the 1960s by John Conway and Michael Paterson). To add
some arithmetic practice to the game, English teacher Grace Obaayaa Tweneboah suggested that the nodes have numerical
point values, and that when a new node was created it would get points equal to the sum of the old nodes it sprouted from.
Unlike traditional Sprouts, it does not matter who makes the last move. Instead players add up the points of all the nodes they
created, and the highest total wins.
When played at FHRCJHS on Pi Day 2024 it was a tremendous hit with students and teachers alike. We have decided to call it
“Ghana Sprouts” because as far as we know it has not yet been played anywhere else. However, if it turns out that someone
else invented it rst, we’re happy to yield naming rights. Please let us know if you’ve seen this before!
Here’s a sample game to show how it’s played. Note that there can be any number of starting nodes, and they can be given
any point values. For a short game we’ll start with 4 nodes, and for simplicity they’ll have the same point value =1.
If you haven’t played Sprouts before, the two essential rules are (1) new lines can’t cross old lines, and (2) each node can have
no more than 3 lines touching it.
Here we go! I’ll give players A and B di erent colors to make the action clearer, but as long as they clearly indicate who
created which node, it’s ne for them to use the same color pen or pencil. In this example game I’m going to illustrate moves
that are legal, and indicate which might appear to be good or bad. But I’m not making any claims to thoughtful or strategic
play! (Indeed, since we just invented Ghana Sprouts a few days ago, we haven’t had a chance to think about strategy.)
Starting configuration:

Player A (blue) ’s first move:

Player B (red) might well respond with

A would love to connect the blue node with value 2 to the red node with value 3, but the blue 2 has 3 lines so it is no longer
available. So they might play:

B sees an opportunity to create a little topological mayhem:

But that doesn’t faze A:

It would seem natural for B to keep going for high-point new node opportunities:

However B’s last move opens an opportunity for A to also create an even higher-point node:

If you have played traditional Sprouts, you are familiar with the gradual narrowing of possibilities as nodes “saturate” with the
maximum of 3 lines touching them. B has no choice except to connect the remaining value-1 nodes,

And the game coasts rapidly

to the point where no new nodes can be sprouted

without new lines crossing old lines (as you would if you tried to connect the red 4 to the blue 8).

In traditional Sprouts B would have just won, as A has no legal moves left. But in Ghana Sprouts we add the points:
A = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 23 ;
B = 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 4 = 21. It’s close but A edges out B for the win!
I hope this example was easy to follow? I also hope that you were able to sense the rising tension as the value of new nodes
increased, raising the stakes associated with subsequent moves. In the rst public game, on Pi Day 2024, between teachers
at FHRCJHS, with all the students watching, the excitement rivaled school football (soccer) matches. The day after Pi Day
students were playing on all the available blackboard space, and a few were playing with chalk on the concrete oors. There
could have been a little Pi Day magic contributing to the energy in the atmosphere, but it seems like Ghana Sprouts has
staying power. It’s probably the most fun many of our students ever had involving math!
I should say that the students were not just playing with an initial layout of 4 nodes each of value 1. There were games with 5,
6, and even 10 starting nodes - though I think the kids who started with 10 nodes quickly ran out of board space. You (the
teacher) can give the initial nodes di erent values than all 1’s, especially if you want your students to practice adding bigger
numbers.
If you’re receiving this, it’s because I hope that you will try Ghana Sprouts with friends and/or colleagues, or even a romantic
partner if you’re con dent your relationship can survive a mild challenge. If you’re a teacher, teach your students to play! I
would love to hear how you like the game, how the other folks like the game, and any other thoughts or reactions that occur to
you. In particular, let us know if we have reinvented someone else’s game. And even if we haven’t duplicated another’s e ort,
but you know of another game with interesting similarities, we’d love to hear about it.
Besides Grace Obaayaa, thanks to fellow teachers Charles, Famous, Francis, Gabriel, Gameli, Gladys, Rosina, Samuel, and
Headmistress Emmanuella for enthusiastic participation in Pi Day activities!
Oops! I forgot to mention that the end result of a Sprouts game, either traditional or Ghana, is a map that is really fun to color.
You never need more than 4 colors, but sometimes you can get away with 3 or fewer! This was a staple activity whenever the
University of Arizona (Bruce’s former employer) Math Department had outreach events.
